SDA Expo Demo

This is a minimal Expo app scaffold to get you started with React Native + Expo.

PowerShell instructions (Windows):

1. Open PowerShell and change to the project folder:

```powershell
cd 'C:\Users\Pony\Documents\SDA_Final_APP'
```

2. Install dependencies (use `npm`):

```powershell
npm install
```

3. Start Expo (use `npx` so you don't need global installs):

```powershell
npx expo start
```

4. Follow Expo's Metro UI in the browser or scan the QR code with Expo Go (Android/iOS).

Notes and troubleshooting:
- If you prefer a globally installed CLI: `npm install -g expo-cli` then run `expo start`.
- If Metro complains about SDK version mismatch, update `expo` in `package.json` to a compatible version or install matching Expo Go.

Next steps:
- Replace `App.js` with your app screens.
- Add navigation (React Navigation) if you need multiple screens.
- Let me know if you want a template with navigation, example API fetching, or native modules.
